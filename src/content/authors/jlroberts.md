bio: I am an Android Engineer currently located in Ohio working for Corporate Tools. I love continuing my learning in all things Android and Kotlin, however will take quite a few detours learning other languages and technologies. When I'm not learning or starting a new project I am reading or spending time with family. If you can't find me, you'll find me on my motorcycle getting away.
